# todo

This is a plain-text (I'm very tired of Trello as its cards are too huge to fit all my incomplete lists even in a few screens) and public (I hope there will never be anything to hide) ToDo list. You may ask any questions by opening issues if you want, but most likely you won't even read till this phrase. Otherwise you're welcome ;-)
